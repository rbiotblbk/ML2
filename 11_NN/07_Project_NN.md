# Project 

using FashionMNIST, write an application which takes a MNIST Fashion dataset and train different models (NN, CNN) and compare scoring between both
- Use loggers
- Try to use dynamic archticture of the network (JSON file which will have different model architectures (count of hidden layers, count of neorons, etc.))
- Save the model for future use
- After training the model, the application should generate a report (Text file) about the model including "name of the model, the architecture, the accuracy, etc.)
- Functionalwise, Much better OOP


## Optional:
after finishing the process, send a telegram message / In-App Chat applications / Message Portals
