# Project 5 
 
- Copy the final model from 02_Multi_Variable as trained model (pickle / joblib)

- Create a backend using FastAPI to cover the multi-variable (area, room count --> price ) project. So that the consumer should provide the two inputs (area, and room count) 
and the system will predict the price .


- Create a front end using Streamlit cover the multi-variable (area, room count --> price ) project. So that the consumer should provide the two inputs (area, and room count) 
and the system will predict the price .

- The front-end(Streamlit) should use the Back-end(Fast api) to use the model
